## 📜 Ground Rules

A community like this should be **open**, **considerate** and **respectful**.

Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

* **Being open**. Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise.
* **Focusing on what is best for the community**. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
* **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences**. We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
* **Showing empathy towards other community members**. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
* **Being respectful**. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language**. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

## 🤝 Responsibilities

* **Ensure cross-platform compatibility** for every change that's accepted. Android and iOS.
* **Ensure that code** that goes into the repository **meets all requirements**
* **Create issues for any major changes** and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* **Don't add** any classes to the codebase **unless absolutely needed**. Err on the side of using functions.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## 🧑‍💻 Code Contribution

To contribute code to the repository, you don't need any permissions.
First start by forking the repository, clone and checkout your clone and start coding.
When you're happy with your changes, create Atomic commits on a **new feature branch** and push it to ***your*** fork.

Atomic commits will make it easier to track down regressions. Also, it enables the ability to cherry-pick or revert a change if needed.

1. Fork it (https://github.com/hexascribe/vertexai-kt/fork)
2. Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/fooBar`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
